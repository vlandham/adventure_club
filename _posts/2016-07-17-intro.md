# Introduction

![](img/all.png){ width=100% }

Hello, and welcome to Adventure Club. We are excited you are making the choice to
join us.

This book will serve as a starting point for picking worthwhile adventures to take,
and as a guide for getting the most out of your adventuring.

But first, some information about what Adventure Club is, and how it is organized.

## The Club

Adventure Club is about getting you out into nature.
As such, the focus is on nature, and on you. 

## Adventures

As you might have guessed, Adventure Club's main focus is on taking adventures.

In the club, an adventure is a specific experience you take part in.
Some adventures have specific tasks

This book provides you the reader the possible adventures of the Adventure Club.

Adventures should be worthwhile, interesting, and fun.

## The Four Paths

Adventuring can take many forms. While the focus of Adventure Club is on exploring and engaging with nature,
we understand that our adventures can also take place in our homes, communities, and even in ourselves.

For this reason, Adventure Club promotes adventures along four main paths:

* Nature
* Self
* Family
* Community

These paths serve to group and organize adventures, with the understanding that
adventures in reality often cross multiple paths.

These paths focus on different types of adventures. No one path is better or worse then the others,
but they allow different people to adventure in ways that most interest them.

## Adventure Badges

Completing the right combinations of adventures will earn you adventure badges.
